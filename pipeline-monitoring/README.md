# Monitoring

Model monitoring and data drift monitoring are key components in maintaining the performance of any predictive model over time. Here are the key aspects to consider for your Bitcoin price prediction model:

1. **Model Performance Monitoring**: Regularly evaluate your model's performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc., depending on the nature of your problem (classification, regression, etc.). Track these metrics over time. If there's a substantial decrease, your model might need retraining or updating.

2. **Data Drift Monitoring**: This involves checking if the distribution of the model's input data is changing over time. You want to make sure that the data your model was trained on is representative of the data it is making predictions on. If the data drifts too much, the model’s performance might decrease.

To monitor data drift, you can use a two-sample t-test, which compares the means of two groups to determine if they're significantly different. Here's how to do it:

a. Consider one feature at a time. For instance, start with 'Volume'.
b. From your current data, take a sample. Compute its mean (let's call it mean1) and standard deviation (std1).
c. Take a sample of the same size from the data your model was trained on. Compute its mean (mean2) and standard deviation (std2).
d. Use the t-test formula to calculate the t-score. The formula is `t = (mean1 - mean2) / sqrt((std1^2/n1) + (std2^2/n2))`, where n1 and n2 are the sizes of your samples.
e. If the absolute t-score is large (greater than the critical t-value for your desired confidence level), then the means are significantly different, indicating data drift.

Remember to conduct this test for all relevant features ('Open', 'Close', 'Volume', etc.) and over regular intervals (daily, weekly, etc.) to ensure continuous monitoring.

3. **Concept Drift Monitoring**: Sometimes, even if the data distribution stays the same, the underlying relationship between the input features and the target variable might change. This is called concept drift. To monitor this, you can look for a decrease in your model's performance over time, even when there's no significant data drift.

Lastly, while t-tests can help in identifying drifts, they are just one part of the puzzle. Monitoring residuals (the differences between your model’s predictions and the actual values) can also provide insights into whether the model is continuing to perform well.

## Monitor 2

When monitoring your model and data for drifts in the context of predicting Bitcoin price increase or decrease, there are a few techniques you can consider, including statistical tests such as t-tests. Here's a general overview:

1. Model Monitoring: It involves monitoring the performance of your predictive model over time to ensure its accuracy and reliability. Some techniques for model monitoring include:
   - Tracking key performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean absolute error.
   - Monitoring model output distributions to detect significant changes or shifts.
   - Comparing model predictions with actual outcomes to identify discrepancies.

2. Data Monitoring: It involves monitoring the input data used by your model to detect any changes or drifts that may impact the model's performance. Here are a few methods for data monitoring:
   - Statistical tests: T-tests can be used to compare statistical properties (e.g., means) of different data subsets or time periods. For example, you can compare Bitcoin price increase predictions for different time intervals to identify significant differences.
   - Control charts: These graphical tools help detect shifts or anomalies in data distribution, allowing you to identify potential drifts.
   - Concept drift detection: Techniques like change point detection algorithms or sliding window approaches can be employed to detect significant changes in the underlying data distribution.

Remember, model and data monitoring should be an ongoing process to ensure the reliability of your predictions. Regularly evaluating and updating your model can help account for evolving market dynamics and improve its performance.
